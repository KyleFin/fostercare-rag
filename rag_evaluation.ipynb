The program provides financial assistance and often medical coverage to help families like siblings stay together by enabling relatives or caring adults to assume guardianship of the child, fostering a permanent relationship.\\n\\nHow KinGAP Helps Families:\\n- It allows children to remain with familiar and connected family members or caregivers, promoting stability and ongoing relationships.\\n- It provides financial support similar to foster care payments, helping guardians meet the child's needs.\\n- It offers medical coverage for the child, which can continue even if the guardianship ends before the child turns 18, up to age 21 in some cases.\\n- The program encourages sibling placement together when possible, further supporting sibling bonds.\\n\\nWhat families should know about the guidelines and decision-making:\\n- Eligibility requires that the child has been in foster care for at least six months with a fully certified or approved foster parent and demonstrates a strong attachment to the caregiver.\\n- The child must be under age 21, and the placement must be deemed in the child's best interests, with other options like return home or adoption considered unsuitable.\\n- A court hearing (initial permanency hearing and fact-finding hearing if applicable) must have occurred, and the case involves legal evaluations.\\n- Criminal and child abuse/maltreatment background checks are necessary for adults in the household.\\n- Families are encouraged to discuss options with their caseworker and complete an application to determine eligibility.\\n- Once approved, families sign a Kinship Guardianship Assistance Agreement detailing the support and responsibilities, including the option to specify a successor guardian.\\n- Families should be aware of ongoing responsibilities such as reporting significant changes in the child's circumstances to LDSS/ACS and understanding their rights and responsibilities related to education, medical decisions, and support applications.\\n\\nDecisions about KinGAP are made by local Departments of Social Services/Office of Children and Family Services (LDSS/ACS) after reviewing eligibility and the child's best interests. Families have the right to request a fair hearing if denied and should consult their caseworker for detailed advice tailored to their specific case.\""

It encourages placements with family members and provides financial and support services to help these families keep the child within their kinship network for long-term stability.\\n\\nHere's how it helps families stay together in permanency options:\\n- **Supports kinship guardianship:** KinGAP allows approved caregivers to become legal guardians of the child, reducing the likelihood of a child being placed outside their family or community.\\n- **Financial assistance:** Guardians receive monthly Kinship Guardianship Assistance payments, which are comparable to foster care payments and can be adjusted based on income and family size.\\n- **Expenses reimbursement:** There is also a one-time reimbursement of up to $2,000 for expenses related to assuming guardianship, such as legal fees.\\n- **Continued support:** Payments can continue until the child turns 18 or 21, provided the guardian meets specific ongoing responsibilities, such as supporting the child's education or employment activities.\\n\\nFamilies should know the following about the guidelines and decision-making:\\n- **Application process:** You must discuss KinGAP with your caseworker and submit an application after meeting specific criteria, such as the child being in your care for at least six months and court hearings having taken place.\\n- **Eligibility assessments:** LDSS/ACS evaluates whether kinship guardianship is a suitable permanency plan based on your case and the child's circumstances.\\n- **Agreement signing:** Once approved, you will review and sign a Kinship Guardianship Assistance Agreement that details the payment structure, services, and options for naming a successor guardian.\\n- **Court process:** Legal guardianship is finalized through a court petition; the assistance payments begin once guardianship letters are issued.\\n- **Ongoing responsibilities:** Guardians must comply with annual certifications regarding the child's status, and guardianship can be extended until the child is 18 or 21 if certain conditions are met.\\n\\nDecisions about kinship guardianship under KinGAP are made based on individual case factors, including the child's best interests, the stability of the placement, and the caregiver's ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment. Families are encouraged to work closely with their caseworkers to understand all options and requirements to determine the best permanency plan for the child.\""
